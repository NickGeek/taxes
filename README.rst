==================
Taxes are annoying
==================

I think Python is easier to use than most spreadsheet programs so I just made a quick 
script that parses `ASB <https://asb.co.nz>`_ CSV exports and computes all the extra tax
information I need. The ``compute_taxes`` function in ``taxes/calc.py`` is designed to be
edited by the user of the script to suit the user.

I don't think this will be useful to anyone except for me because I just hard coded 
everything for my specific needs but it shouldn't be too hard to adapt the script.
